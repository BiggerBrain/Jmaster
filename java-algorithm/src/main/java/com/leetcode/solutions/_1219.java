/**
 * 1219. Path with Maximum Gold
 *
 * In a gold mine grid of size m * n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.
 * Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:
 * Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
 * From your position you can walk one step to the left, right, up or down.
 * You can't visit the same cell more than once.
 * Never visit a cell with 0 gold.
 * You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
 * Output: 24
 * Explanation:
 * [[0,6,0],
 *  [5,8,7],
 *  [0,9,0]]
 * Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: grid = [[1,0,7],[2,0,6],[3,4,5],[0,3,0],[9,0,20]]
 * Output: 28
 * Explanation:
 * [[1,0,7],
 *  [2,0,6],
 *  [3,4,5],
 *  [0,3,0],
 *  [9,0,20]]
 * Path to get the maximum gold, 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 15
 * 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
 * There are at most 25 cells containing gold.
