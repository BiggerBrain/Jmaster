/**
 * 634. Find the Derangement of An Array
 *
 * In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.

 There's originally an array consisting of n integers from 1 to n in ascending order, you need to find the number of derangement it can generate.

 Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod 109 + 7.

 Example 1:
 Input: 3
 Output: 2
 Explanation: The original array is [1,2,3]. The two derangements are [2,3,1] and [3,1,2].

 Note:
 n is in the range of [1, 106].
