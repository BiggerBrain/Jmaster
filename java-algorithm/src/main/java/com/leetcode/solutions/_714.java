/**
 * 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee
 *
 * Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i;
 * and a non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee.
 * You may complete as many transactions as you like,
 * but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.
 * You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)

 Return the maximum profit you can make.

 Example 1:
 Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
 Output: 8
 Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
 Buying at prices[0] = 1
 Selling at prices[3] = 8
 Buying at prices[4] = 4
 Selling at prices[5] = 9
 The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.

 Note:
 0 < prices.length <= 50000.
 0 < prices[i] < 50000.
 0 <= fee < 50000.
