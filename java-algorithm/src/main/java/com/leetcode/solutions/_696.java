/**
 * 696. Count Binary Substrings
 *
 * Give a string s, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's,
 * and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.
 * Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

 Example 1:

 Input: "00110011"
 Output: 6
 Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".

 Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.

 Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.

 Example 2:

 Input: "10101"
 Output: 4
 Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.

 Note:
 s.length will be between 1 and 50,000.
 s will only consist of "0" or "1" characters.
