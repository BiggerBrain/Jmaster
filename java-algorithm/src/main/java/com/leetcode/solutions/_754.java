/**
 * 754. Reach a Number
 *
 * You are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. There is a goal at position target.
 * On each move, you can either go left or right. During the n-th move (starting from 1), you take n steps.
 * Return the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination.

 Example 1:
 Input: target = 3
 Output: 2
 Explanation:
 On the first move we step from 0 to 1.
 On the second step we step from 1 to 3.

 Example 2:
 Input: target = 2
 Output: 3
 Explanation:
 On the first move we step from 0 to 1.
 On the second move we step  from 1 to -1.
 On the third move we step from -1 to 2.

 Note:
 target will be a non-zero integer in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
