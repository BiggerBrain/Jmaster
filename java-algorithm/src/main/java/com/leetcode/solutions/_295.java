/**
 * 295. Find Median from Data Stream
 *
 * Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list.
 * If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value.
 * So the median is the mean of the two middle value.

 Examples:
 [2,3,4] , the median is 3

 [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

 Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

 void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
 double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.
 For example:

 addNum(1)
 addNum(2)
 findMedian() -> 1.5
 addNum(3)
 findMedian() -> 2

    /**A few key points for both following solutions:
     *
     * 1. always keep one queue one element more than the other if the number is odd, offer into that one
     * first, then poll from that queue and offer into the other queue, then check whether that queue is smaller
     * in size than the other, if so, poll one from the other queue and offer it into this queue
     *
     * 2. only need to check whether this bigger queue size is greater than the other queue when returning.*/
