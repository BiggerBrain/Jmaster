/**
 * 1051. Height Checker
 *
 * Students are asked to stand in non-decreasing order of heights for an annual photo.
 * Return the minimum number of students not standing in the right positions.
 * (This is the number of students that must move in order for all students to be standing in non-decreasing order of height.)
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [1,1,4,2,1,3]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * Students with heights 4, 3 and the last 1 are not standing in the right positions.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 1 <= heights.length <= 100
 * 1 <= heights[i] <= 100
