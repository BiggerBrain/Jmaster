/**
 * 317. Shortest Distance from All Buildings
 *
 * You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance.
 * You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:

 Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
 Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
 Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.

 For example, given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2):

 1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
 |   |   |   |   |
 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
 |   |   |   |   |
 0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0

 The point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.

 Note:
 There will be at least one building. If it is not possible to build such house according to the above rules, return -1.
