/**
 * 260. Single Number III
 *
 * Given an array of numbers nums,
 * in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice.
 * Find the two elements that appear only once.

For example:

Given nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5], return [3, 5].

Note:
The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

         * some more explanation about this algorithm:
         * two's complement: one number's two's complement number is computed as below:
         * reverse all bits of this number and then add one:
         * e.g. decimal number 2, in binary format: 0010 (4 bits)
         * reversing every single bit becomes 1101,
         * then add 1 to it, it becomes 1110
         *
         * so
         * num &= -num, in this case, 2 &= -2 becomes 2
