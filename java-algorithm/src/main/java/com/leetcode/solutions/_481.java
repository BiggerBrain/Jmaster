/**
 * 481. Magical String
 *
 * A magical string S consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:

 The string S is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string S itself.

 The first few elements of string S is the following: S = "1221121221221121122……"

 If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in S, it will be:

 1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......

 and the occurrences of '1's or '2's in each group are:

 1 2	2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......

 You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the S itself.

 Given an integer N as input, return the number of '1's in the first N number in the magical string S.

 Note: N will not exceed 100,000.

 Example 1:
 Input: 6
 Output: 3
 Explanation: The first 6 elements of magical string S is "12211" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.

         * Algorithm:
         *
         * 1. Create an int array a and initialize the first 3 elements with 1, 2, 2.
         * 2. Create two pointers head and tail. head points to the number which will be used to generate new numbers.
         * tail points to the next empty position to put the new number. Then keep generating new numbers until tail >= n.
         * 3. Need to create the array 1 element more than n to avoid overflow because the last round head might points to a number 2.
         * 4. A trick to flip number back and forth between 1 and 2: num = num ^ 3
