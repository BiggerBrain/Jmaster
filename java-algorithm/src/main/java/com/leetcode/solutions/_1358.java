/**
 * 1358. Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters
 *
 * Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.
 * Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "abcabc"
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again).
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "aaacb"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb".
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: s = "abc"
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
 * s only consists of a, b or c characters.
