/**
 * 522. Longest Uncommon Subsequence II
 *
 * Given a list of strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence among them.
 * The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence of one of these strings and
 * this subsequence should not be any subsequence of the other strings.
 * A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some characters
 * without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 * Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of any string.
 * The input will be a list of strings, and the output needs to be the length of the longest uncommon subsequence.
 * If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.

 Example 1:
 Input: "aba", "cdc", "eae"
 Output: 3
 Note:

 All the given strings' lengths will not exceed 10.
 The length of the given list will be in the range of [2, 50].
