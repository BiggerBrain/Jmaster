/**
 * 243. Shortest Word Distance
 *
 * Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

 For example,
 Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

 Given word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”, return 3.
 Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding", return 1.

 Note:
 You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.*/
