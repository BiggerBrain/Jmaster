/**
 * 441. Arranging Coins
 *
 * You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

 Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

 n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

 Example 1:

 n = 5

 The coins can form the following rows:
 ¤
 ¤ ¤
 ¤ ¤

 Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.


 Example 2:

 n = 8

 The coins can form the following rows:
 ¤
 ¤ ¤
 ¤ ¤ ¤
 ¤ ¤

 Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.*/
