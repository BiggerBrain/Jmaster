/**
 * 762. Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation
 *
 * Given two integers L and R, find the count of numbers in the range [L, R] (inclusive) having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.
 * (Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of 1s present when written in binary.
 * For example, 21 written in binary is 10101 which has 3 set bits. Also, 1 is not a prime.)

 Example 1:

 Input: L = 6, R = 10
 Output: 4

 Explanation:
 6 -> 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
 7 -> 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
 9 -> 1001 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)
 10->1010 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)

 Example 2:

 Input: L = 10, R = 15
 Output: 5

 Explanation:
 10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
 11 -> 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
 12 -> 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
 13 -> 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
 14 -> 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
 15 -> 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)

 Note:

 L, R will be integers L <= R in the range [1, 10^6].
 R - L will be at most 10000.
