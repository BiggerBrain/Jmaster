/**
 * 238. Product of Array Except Self
 *
 * Given an array of n integers where n > 1, nums,
 * return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
 * Solve it without division and in O(n).
 * For example, given [1,2,3,4], return [24,12,8,6].

 Follow up:
 Could you solve it with constant space complexity?
 (Note: The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

         * right *= nums[i];
