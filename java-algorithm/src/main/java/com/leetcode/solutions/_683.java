/**
 * 683. K Empty Slots
 *
 *  There is a garden with N slots. In each slot, there is a flower.
 *
 *  The N flowers will bloom one by one in N days.
 *
 *  In each day, there will be exactly one flower blooming and it will be in the status of blooming since then.
 *
 *  Given an array flowers consists of number from 1 to N. Each number in the array represents the place where the flower will open in that day.
 *  For example, flowers[i] = x means that the unique flower that blooms at day i will be at position x,
 *  where i and x will be in the range from 1 to N.
 *
 *  Also given an integer k, you need to output in which day there exists two flowers in the status of blooming,
 *  and also the number of flowers between them is k and these flowers are not blooming.
 *  If there isn't such day, output -1.

 Example 1:
 Input:
 flowers: [1,3,2]
 k: 1
 Output: 2
 Explanation: In the second day, the first and the third flower have become blooming.

 Example 2:
 Input:
 flowers: [1,2,3]
 k: 1
 Output: -1

 Note:
 The given array will be in the range [1, 20000].
