/**
 * 117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II
 *
 * Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node".
 * What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?

 Note:

 You may only use constant extra space.
 For example,
 Given the following binary tree,
      1
    /  \
   2    3
  / \    \
 4   5    7
 After calling your function, the tree should look like:
      1 -> NULL
    /  \
   2 -> 3 -> NULL
  / \    \
 4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL */
