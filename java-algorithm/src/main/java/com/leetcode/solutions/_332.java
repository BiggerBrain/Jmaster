/**
 * 332. Reconstruct Itinerary
 *
 * Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to],
 * reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

 Note:
 If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.
 For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].

 All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).

 You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
 Example 1:
 tickets = [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
 Return ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"].

 Example 2:
 tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
 Return ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"].
 Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"]. But it is larger in lexical order.
