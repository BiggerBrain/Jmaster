/**
 * 1373. Maximum Sum BST in Binary Tree
 *
 * Given a binary tree root, the task is to return the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST).
 * Assume a BST is defined as follows:
 * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: root = [1,4,3,2,4,2,5,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,6]
 * Output: 20
 * Explanation: Maximum sum in a valid Binary search tree is obtained in root node with key equal to 3.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: root = [4,3,null,1,2]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Maximum sum in a valid Binary search tree is obtained in a single root node with key equal to 2.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: root = [-4,-2,-5]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: All values are negatives. Return an empty BST.
 *
 * Example 4:
 * Input: root = [2,1,3]
 * Output: 6
 *
 * Example 5:
 * Input: root = [5,4,8,3,null,6,3]
 * Output: 7
 *
 * Constraints:
 * Each tree has at most 40000 nodes..
 * Each node's value is between [-4 * 10^4 , 4 * 10^4].
