/**
 * 552. Student Attendance Record II
 *
 * Given a positive integer n, return the number of all possible attendance records with length n,
 * which will be regarded as rewardable. The answer may be very large, return it after mod 109 + 7.

 A student attendance record is a string that only contains the following three characters:

 'A' : Absent.
 'L' : Late.
 'P' : Present.

 A record is regarded as rewardable if it doesn't contain more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).

 Example 1:

 Input: n = 2
 Output: 8

 Explanation:
 There are 8 records with length 2 will be regarded as rewardable:
 "PP" , "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL"
 Only "AA" won't be regarded as rewardable owing to more than one absent times.

 Note: The value of n won't exceed 100,000.
