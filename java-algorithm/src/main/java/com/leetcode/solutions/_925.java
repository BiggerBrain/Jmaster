/**
 * 925. Long Pressed Name
 *
 * Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard.
 * Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get long pressed,
 * and the character will be typed 1 or more times.
 *
 * You examine the typed characters of the keyboard.
 * Return True if it is possible that it was your friends name,
 * with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it wasn't in the typed output.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: name = "leelee", typed = "lleeelee"
 * Output: true
 * Example 4:
 *
 * Input: name = "laiden", typed = "laiden"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: It's not necessary to long press any character.
 *
 * Note:
 * name.length <= 1000
 * typed.length <= 1000
 * The characters of name and typed are lowercase letters.
