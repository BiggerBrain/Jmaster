/**
 * 750. Number Of Corner Rectangles
 *
 * Given a grid where each entry is only 0 or 1, find the number of corner rectangles.
 * A corner rectangle is 4 distinct 1s on the grid that form an axis-aligned rectangle.
 * Note that only the corners need to have the value 1. Also, all four 1s used must be distinct.

 Example 1:
 Input: grid =
 [[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]]
 Output: 1
 Explanation: There is only one corner rectangle, with corners grid[1][2], grid[1][4], grid[3][2], grid[3][4].

 Example 2:
 Input: grid =
 [[1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]
 Output: 9
 Explanation: There are four 2x2 rectangles, four 2x3 and 3x2 rectangles, and one 3x3 rectangle.

 Example 3:
 Input: grid =
 [[1, 1, 1, 1]]
 Output: 0
 Explanation: Rectangles must have four distinct corners.

 Note:
 The number of rows and columns of grid will each be in the range [1, 200].
 Each grid[i][j] will be either 0 or 1.
 The number of 1s in the grid will be at most 6000.*/
