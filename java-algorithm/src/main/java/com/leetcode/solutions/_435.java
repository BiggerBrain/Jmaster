/**
 * 435. Non-overlapping Intervals
 *
 * Given a collection of intervals,
 * find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the
 * intervals non-overlapping.

 Note:
 You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
 Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.

 Example 1:
 Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]
 Output: 1
 Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.

 Example 2:
 Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]
 Output: 2
 Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.

 Example 3:
 Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]
 Output: 0
 Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
