/**
 * 370. Range Addition
 *
 * Assume you have an array of length n initialized with all 0's and are given k update operations.
 * Each operation is represented as a triplet: [startIndex, endIndex, inc]
 * which increments each element of subarray A[startIndex ... endIndex] (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with inc.
 * Return the modified array after all k operations were executed.

 Example:

 Given:

 length = 5,
 updates = [
 [1,  3,  2],
 [2,  4,  3],
 [0,  2, -2]
 ]

 Output:

 [-2, 0, 3, 5, 3]
 Explanation:

 Initial state:
 [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]

 After applying operation [1, 3, 2]:
 [ 0, 2, 2, 2, 0 ]

 After applying operation [2, 4, 3]:
 [ 0, 2, 5, 5, 3 ]

 After applying operation [0, 2, -2]:
 [-2, 0, 3, 5, 3 ]

 Hint:
 Thinking of using advanced data structures? You are thinking it too complicated.
 For each update operation, do you really need to update all elements between i and j?
 Update only the first and end element is sufficient.
 The optimal time complexity is O(k + n) and uses O(1) extra space.
