/**
 * 675. Cut Off Trees for Golf Event
 *
 * You are asked to cut off trees in a forest for a golf event.
 * The forest is represented as a non-negative 2D map, in this map:
 * 0 represents the obstacle can't be reached.
 * 1 represents the ground can be walked through.
 *
 * The place with number bigger than 1 represents a tree can be walked through,
 * and this positive number represents the tree's height.
 *
 * You are asked to cut off all the trees in this forest in the order of tree's height -
 * always cut off the tree with lowest height first.
 * And after cutting, the original place has the tree will become a grass (value 1).
 *
 * You will start from the point (0, 0) and you should output the minimum steps you need to walk to cut off all the trees.
 *
 * If you can't cut off all the trees, output -1 in that situation.
 * You are guaranteed that no two trees have the same height and there is at least one tree needs to be cut off.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * [
 * [1,2,3],
 * [0,0,4],
 * [7,6,5]
 * ]
 * Output: 6
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * [
 * [1,2,3],
 * [0,0,0],
 * [7,6,5]
 * ]
 * Output: -1
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input:
 * [
 * [2,3,4],
 * [0,0,5],
 * [8,7,6]
 * ]
 * Output: 6
 *
 * Explanation: You started from the point (0,0) and you can cut off the tree in (0,0) directly without walking.
 * Hint: size of the given matrix will not exceed 50x50.
