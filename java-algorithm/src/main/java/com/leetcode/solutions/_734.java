/**
 * 734. Sentence Similarity
 *
 * Given two sentences words1, words2 (each represented as an array of strings), and a list of similar word pairs pairs, determine if two sentences are similar.
 * For example, "great acting skills" and "fine drama talent" are similar, if the similar word pairs are pairs = [["great", "fine"], ["acting","drama"], ["skills","talent"]].
 * Note that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, if "great" and "fine" are similar, and "fine" and "good" are similar, "great" and "good" are not necessarily similar.
 * Also, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences words1 = ["great"], words2 = ["great"], pairs = [] are similar, even though there are no specified similar word pairs.

 Note:

 The length of words1 and words2 will not exceed 1000.
 The length of pairs will not exceed 2000.
 The length of each pairs[i] will be 2.
 The length of each words[i] and pairs[i][j] will be in the range [1, 20].
