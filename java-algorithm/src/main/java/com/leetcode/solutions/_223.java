/**
 * 223. Rectangle Area
 *
 * Find the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.
 * Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as shown in the figure.
 * Rectangle Area

 Example:

 Input: A = -3, B = 0, C = 3, D = 4, E = 0, F = -1, G = 9, H = 2
 Output: 45

 Note: Assume that the total area is never beyond the maximum possible value of int.*/

            int areaA = (C - A) * (D - B);
            int areaB = (G - E) * (H - F);

            int top = Math.min(D, H);
            int bottom = Math.max(B, F);
            int left = Math.max(A, E);
            int right = Math.min(C, G);

            int overlap = 0;
            if (top > bottom && right > left) {
                overlap = (top - bottom) * (right - left);
