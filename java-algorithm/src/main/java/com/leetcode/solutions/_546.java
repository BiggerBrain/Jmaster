/**
 * 546. Remove Boxes
 *
 * Given several boxes with different colors represented by different positive numbers.
 * You may experience several rounds to remove boxes until there is no box left.
 * Each time you can choose some continuous boxes with the same color (composed of k boxes, k >= 1), remove them and get k*k points.
 * Find the maximum points you can get.

 Example 1:
 Input:

 [1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1]
 Output:
 23

 Explanation:
 [1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1]
 ----> [1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 1] (3*3=9 points)
 ----> [1, 3, 3, 3, 1] (1*1=1 points)
 ----> [1, 1] (3*3=9 points)
 ----> [] (2*2=4 points)
 Note: The number of boxes n would not exceed 100.
