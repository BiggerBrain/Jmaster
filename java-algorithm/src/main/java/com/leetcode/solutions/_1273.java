/**
 * 1273. Delete Tree Nodes
 *
 * A tree rooted at node 0 is given as follows:
 * The number of nodes is nodes;
 * The value of the i-th node is value[i];
 * The parent of the i-th node is parent[i].
 * Remove every subtree whose sum of values of nodes is zero.
 * After doing so, return the number of nodes remaining in the tree.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *                      0 (1)
 *                     /  \
 *               (-2) 1    2 (4)
 *                   /    / |   \
 *              (0)3 (-2)4 (-1)5 6(-1)
 *
 * Input: nodes = 7, parent = [-1,0,0,1,2,2,2], value = [1,-2,4,0,-2,-1,-1]
 * Output: 2
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= nodes <= 10^4
 * -10^5 <= value[i] <= 10^5
 * parent.length == nodes
 * parent[0] == -1 which indicates that 0 is the root.
