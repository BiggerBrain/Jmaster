/**
 * 390. Elimination Game
 *
 * There is a list of sorted integers from 1 to n.
 * Starting from left to right,
 * remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.
 * Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left,
 * remove the right most number and every other number from the remaining numbers.
 * We keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.
 * Find the last number that remains starting with a list of length n.

 Example:

 Input:
 n = 9,
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 2 4 6 8
 2 6
 6

 Output:
 6
