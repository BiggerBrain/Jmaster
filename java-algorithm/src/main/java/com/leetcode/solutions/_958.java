/**
 * 958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree
 *
 * Given a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.
 * Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
 * In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
 * It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *             1
 *            / \
 *           2   3
 *          / \ /
 *         4  5 6
 *
 * Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}),
 * and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *            1
 *           / \
 *          2  3
 *         / \  \
 *        4  5  7
 * Input: [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
 *
 * Note:
 * The tree will have between 1 and 100 nodes.
