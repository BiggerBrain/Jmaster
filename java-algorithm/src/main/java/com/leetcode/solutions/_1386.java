/**
 * 1386. Cinema Seat Allocation
 *
 * A cinema has n rows of seats, numbered from 1 to n and there are ten seats in each row, labelled from 1 to 10 as shown in the figure above.
 * Given the array reservedSeats containing the numbers of seats already reserved, for example, reservedSeats[i]=[3,8] means the seat located in row 3 and labelled with 8 is already reserved.
 * Return the maximum number of four-person families you can allocate on the cinema seats. A four-person family occupies fours seats in one row, that are next to each other.
 * Seats across an aisle (such as [3,3] and [3,4]) are not considered to be next to each other, however, It is permissible for the four-person family to be separated by an aisle, but in that case, exactly two people have to sit on each side of the aisle.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 3, reservedSeats = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,8],[2,6],[3,1],[3,10]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The figure above shows the optimal allocation for four families, where seats mark with blue are already reserved and contiguous seats mark with orange are for one family.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: n = 2, reservedSeats = [[2,1],[1,8],[2,6]]
 * Output: 2
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: n = 4, reservedSeats = [[4,3],[1,4],[4,6],[1,7]]
 * Output: 4
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= n <= 10^9
 * 1 <= reservedSeats.length <= min(10*n, 10^4)
 * reservedSeats[i].length == 2
 * 1 <= reservedSeats[i][0] <= n
 * 1 <= reservedSeats[i][1] <= 10
 * All reservedSeats[i] are distinct.
