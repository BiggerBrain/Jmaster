/**
 * 543. Diameter of Binary Tree
 *
 * Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree.
 * The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree.
 * This path may or may not pass through the root.

 Example:
 Given a binary tree
     1
    / \
   2   3
  / \
 4   5
 Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

 Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

         * 2. And during the recursion, we can keep updating the global variable: "diameter";
         * 3. When computing length/height of a subtree, we should take the max of its left and right, then plus one
         * and left height should be like this
         * int left = dfs(root.left);
         * instead of dfs(root.left) + 1;
         * we'll only plus one at the end
