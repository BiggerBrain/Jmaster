/**
 * You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend:
 * Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -,
 * you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--".
 * The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

 Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.

 For example, given s = "++++", return true. The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+".
