/**
 * 1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree
 *
 * Given the root of a binary search tree with distinct values,
 * modify it so that every node has a new value equal to the sum of the values of the original tree that are greater than or equal to node.val.
 * As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:
 *
 * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *                            4(30)
 *                          /    \
 *                       1(36)   6(21)
 *                     /   \     /    \
 *                 0(36)  2(35) 5(26) 7(15)
 *                          \          \
 *                        3(33)        8(8)
 *
 * Input: [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
 * Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 100.
 * Each node will have value between 0 and 100.
 * The given tree is a binary search tree.*/
