/**
 * 679. 24 Game
 *
 *  You have 4 cards each containing a number from 1 to 9.
 *  You need to judge whether they could operated through *, /, +, -, (, ) to get the value of 24.

 Example 1:
 Input: [4, 1, 8, 7]
 Output: True
 Explanation: (8-4) * (7-1) = 24

 Example 2:
 Input: [1, 2, 1, 2]
 Output: False

 Note:
 The division operator / represents real division, not integer division. For example, 4 / (1 - 2/3) = 12.
 Every operation done is between two numbers.
 In particular, we cannot use - as a unary operator. For example, with [1, 1, 1, 1] as input, the expression -1 - 1 - 1 - 1 is not allowed.
 You cannot concatenate numbers together. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 1, 2], we cannot write this as 12 + 12.
