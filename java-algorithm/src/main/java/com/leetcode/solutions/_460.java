/**
 460. LFU Cache

 Design and implement a data structure for Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache.
 It should support the following operations: get and put.

 get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
 put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity,
 it should invalidate the least frequently used item before inserting a new item.
 For the purpose of this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys that have the same frequency),
 the least recently used key would be evicted.

 Follow up:
 Could you do both operations in O(1) time complexity?

 Example:

 LFUCache cache = new LFUCache( 2 /* capacity  );

        cache.put(1, 1);
        cache.put(2, 2);
        cache.get(1);       // returns 1
        cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2
        cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)
        cache.get(3);       // returns 3.
        cache.put(4, 4);    // evicts key 1.
        cache.get(1);       // returns -1 (not found)
        cache.get(3);       // returns 3
        cache.get(4);       // returns 4

         * Wikipedia: The simplest method to employ an LFU algorithm is to assign a counter to every
         * block that is loaded into the cache. Each time a reference is made to that block the counter
         * is increased by one. When the cache reaches capacity and has a new block waiting to be
         * inserted the system will search for the block with the lowest counter and remove it from the
         * cache.
         * Policy to handle frequency ties: based on timestamp, the entries that get set into cache earlier will be evicted first.
