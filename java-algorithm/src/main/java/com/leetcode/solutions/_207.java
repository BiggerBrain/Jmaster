/**
 * 207. Course Schedule
 *
 * There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1,
 which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
 Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

 For example:
 2, [[1,0]]
 There are a total of 2 courses to take.
 To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
 There are a total of 2 courses to take.
 To take course 1 you should have finished course 0,
 and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

 Note:
 The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
 You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

 Hints:
 This problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.
 Topological Sort via DFS - A great video tutorial (21 minutes) on Coursera explaining the basic concepts of Topological Sort.
 Topological sort could also be done via BFS.
