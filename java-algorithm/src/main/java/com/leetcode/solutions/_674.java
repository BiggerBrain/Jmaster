/**
 * 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence.

 Example 1:
 Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
 Output: 3
 Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5],
 its length is 3. Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence,
 it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4.

 Example 2:
 Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
 Output: 1
 Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1.

 Note: Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.
