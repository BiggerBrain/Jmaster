/**
 * 587. Erect the Fence
 *
 * There are some trees, where each tree is represented by (x,y) coordinate in a two-dimensional garden.
 * Your job is to fence the entire garden using the minimum length of rope as it is expensive.
 * The garden is well fenced only if all the trees are enclosed.
 * Your task is to help find the coordinates of trees which are exactly located on the fence perimeter.

 Example 1:
 Input: [[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]]
 Output: [[1,1],[2,0],[4,2],[3,3],[2,4]]
 Explanation:

 Example 2:
 Input: [[1,2],[2,2],[4,2]]
 Output: [[1,2],[2,2],[4,2]]
 Explanation:

 Even you only have trees in a line, you need to use rope to enclose them.

 Note:
 All trees should be enclosed together. You cannot cut the rope to enclose trees that will separate them in more than one group.
 All input integers will range from 0 to 100.
 The garden has at least one tree.
 All coordinates are distinct.
 Input points have NO order. No order required for output.
