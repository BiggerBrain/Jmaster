/**
 * 555. Split Concatenated Strings
 *
 * Given a list of strings, you could concatenate these strings together into a loop,
 * where for each string you could choose to reverse it or not.
 *
 * Among all the possible loops, you need to find the lexicographically biggest string after cutting the loop,
 * which will make the looped string into a regular one.
 *
 * Specifically, to find the lexicographically biggest string, you need to experience two phases:
 *
 * 1. Concatenate all the strings into a loop, where you can reverse some strings or not and connect them in the same order as given.
 * 2. Cut and make one breakpoint in any place of the loop, which will make the looped string into a regular one starting from
 * the character at the cutpoint.
 *
 * And your job is to find the lexicographically biggest one among all the possible regular strings.

 Example:
 Input: "abc", "xyz"
 Output: "zyxcba"

 Explanation: You can get the looped string "-abcxyz-", "-abczyx-", "-cbaxyz-", "-cbazyx-",
 where '-' represents the looped status.
 The answer string came from the fourth looped one,
 where you could cut from the middle character 'a' and get "zyxcba".

 Note:
 The input strings will only contain lowercase letters.
 The total length of all the strings will not over 1,000.
