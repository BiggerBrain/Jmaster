/**
 * 130. Surrounded Regions
 *
 * Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

 A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

 For example,
 X X X X
 X O O X
 X X O X
 X O X X

 After running your function, the board should be:

 X X X X
 X X X X
 X X X X
 X O X X

         * I won't call this problem hard, it's just confusing, you'll definitely want to clarify what
         * the problem means before coding. This problem eactually means: any grid that is 'O' but on
         * the four edges, will never be marked to 'X'; furthermore, any grid that is 'O' and that is
         * connected with the above type of 'O' will never be marked to 'X' as well; only all other
         * nodes that has any one direct neighbor that is an 'X' will be marked to 'X'.
