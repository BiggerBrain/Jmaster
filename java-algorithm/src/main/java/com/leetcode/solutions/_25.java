/**
 * 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group
 *
 * Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.
 * k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list.
 * If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.
 * You may not alter the values in the nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
 * Only constant memory is allowed.

 For example,
 Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5

 For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5

 For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5
