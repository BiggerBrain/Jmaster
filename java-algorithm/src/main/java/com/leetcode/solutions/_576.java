/**
 * 576. Out of Boundary Paths
 *
 * There is an m by n grid with a ball.
 * Given the start coordinate (i,j) of the ball,
 * you can move the ball to adjacent cell or cross the grid boundary in four directions (up, down, left, right).
 * However, you can at most move N times. Find out the number of paths to move the ball out of grid boundary.
 * The answer may be very large, return it after mod 109 + 7.

 Example 1:

 Input:m = 2, n = 2, N = 2, i = 0, j = 0
 Output: 6
 Explanation:

 Example 2:

 Input:m = 1, n = 3, N = 3, i = 0, j = 1
 Output: 12
 Explanation:

 Note:

 Once you move the ball out of boundary, you cannot move it back.
 The length and height of the grid is in range [1,50].
 N is in range [0,50].
