/**
 * 213. House Robber II

 Note: This is an extension of House Robber.

 After robbing those houses on that street,
 the thief has found himself a new place for his thievery
 so that he will not get too much attention.
 This time, all houses at this place are arranged in a circle.
 That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one.
 Meanwhile, the security system for these houses remain the same as for those in the previous street.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house,
 determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
