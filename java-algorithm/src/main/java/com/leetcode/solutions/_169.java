/**
 * 169. Majority Element

 Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.
 You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

 Example 1:
 Input: [3,2,3]
 Output: 3

 Example 2:
 Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
 Output: 2

         * How to understand this:
         * 1. For a number to qualify as a majority element, it needs to occur more than 1/2 times, which
         *          means there are a max of only one such element in any given array.
         * 2. E.g. given this array [1,2,3,1,1,1], two of the 1s will be balanced off by 2 and 3, still there are two 1s remaining in the end
         * which is the majority element*/
