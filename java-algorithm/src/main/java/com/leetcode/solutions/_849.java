/**
 * 849. Maximize Distance to Closest Person
 *
 * In a row of seats, 1 represents a person sitting in that seat, and 0 represents that the seat is empty.
 * There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.
 * Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized.
 * Return that maximum distance to closest person.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * If Alex sits in the second open seat (seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
 * If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
 * Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [1,0,0,0]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * If Alex sits in the last seat, the closest person is 3 seats away.
 * This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.
 * Note:
 *
 * 1 <= seats.length <= 20000
 * seats contains only 0s or 1s, at least one 0, and at least one 1.
