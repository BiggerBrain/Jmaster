/**
 * 463. Island Perimeter
 *
 * You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
 * Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
 * The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).
 * The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island).
 * One cell is a square with side length 1.
 * The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

 Example:

 [[0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0],
 [0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]

 Answer: 16
 Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:

         * 1. we increment the count by 4 whenever we encounter an island
         * 2. also, we check in two directions: island's left and island's top, we only check these two directions,
         * see if this island has any island neighbors, if so, we'll deduct two from it.
