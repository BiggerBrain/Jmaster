/**
 * 464. Can I Win
 *
 * In the "100 game," two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1..10.
 * The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.
 * What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?
 * For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers of 1..15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.
 * Given an integer maxChoosableInteger and another integer desiredTotal, determine if the first player to move can force a win, assuming both players play optimally.
 *You can always assume that maxChoosableInteger will not be larger than 20 and desiredTotal will not be larger than 300.

 Example

 Input:
 maxChoosableInteger = 10
 desiredTotal = 11

 Output:
 false

 Explanation:
 No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
 The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
 If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
 The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
 Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.
