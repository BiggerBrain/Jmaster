/**
 * 1375. Bulb Switcher III
 *
 * There is a room with n bulbs, numbered from 1 to n, arranged in a row from left to right. Initially, all the bulbs are turned off.
 * At moment k (for k from 0 to n - 1), we turn on the light[k] bulb. A bulb change color to blue only if it is on and all the previous bulbs (to the left) are turned on too.
 * Return the number of moments in which all turned on bulbs are blue.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: light = [2,1,3,5,4]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 1, 2 and 4.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: light = [3,2,4,1,5]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 3, and 4 (index-0).
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: light = [4,1,2,3]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 3 (index-0).
 * Bulb 4th changes to blue at the moment 3.
 *
 * Example 4:
 * Input: light = [2,1,4,3,6,5]
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Example 5:
 * Input: light = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
 * Output: 6
 *
 * Constraints:
 * n == light.length
 * 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
 * light is a permutation of  [1, 2, ..., n]
