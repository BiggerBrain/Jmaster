/**
 * 157. Read N Characters Given Read4
 *
 * The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.
 *
 * The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.
 *
 * By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: buf = "abc", n = 4
 * Output: "abc"
 * Explanation: The actual number of characters read is 3, which is "abc".
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: buf = "abcde", n = 5
 * Output: "abcde"
 *
 * Note:
 * The read function will only be called once for each test case.
