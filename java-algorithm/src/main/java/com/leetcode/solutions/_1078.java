/**
 * 5083. Occurrences After Bigram
 * <p>
 * Given words first and second, consider occurrences in some text of the form "first second third",
 * where second comes immediately after first, and third comes immediately after second.
 * For each such occurrence, add "third" to the answer, and return the answer.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: text = "alice is a good girl she is a good student", first = "a", second = "good"
 * Output: ["girl","student"]
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * Input: text = "we will we will rock you", first = "we", second = "will"
 * Output: ["we","rock"]
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * 1 <= text.length <= 1000
 * text consists of space separated words, where each word consists of lowercase English letters.
 * 1 <= first.length, second.length <= 10
 * first and second consist of lowercase English letters.
