/**
 * 1057. Campus Bikes
 *
 * On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are N workers and M bikes, with N <= M. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.
 * Our goal is to assign a bike to each worker.
 * Among the available bikes and workers, we choose the (worker, bike) pair with the shortest Manhattan distance between each other,
 * and assign the bike to that worker. (If there are multiple (worker, bike) pairs with the same shortest Manhattan distance,
 * we choose the pair with the smallest worker index; if there are multiple ways to do that,
 * we choose the pair with the smallest bike index). We repeat this process until there are no available workers.
 *
 * The Manhattan distance between two points p1 and p2 is Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|.
 * Return a vector ans of length N, where ans[i] is the index (0-indexed) of the bike that the i-th worker is assigned to.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
 * Output: [1,0]
 * Explanation:
 * Worker 1 grabs Bike 0 as they are closest (without ties), and Worker 0 is assigned Bike 1. So the output is [1, 0].
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]], bikes = [[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]
 * Output: [0,2,1]
 * Explanation:
 * Worker 0 grabs Bike 0 at first. Worker 1 and Worker 2 share the same distance to Bike 2,
 * thus Worker 1 is assigned to Bike 2, and Worker 2 will take Bike 1. So the output is [0,2,1].
 *
 * Note:
 * 0 <= workers[i][j], bikes[i][j] < 1000
 * All worker and bike locations are distinct.
 * 1 <= workers.length <= bikes.length <= 1000
