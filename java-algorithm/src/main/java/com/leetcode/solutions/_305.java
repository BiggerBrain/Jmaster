/**
 * 305. Number of Islands II
 *
 * A 2d grid map of m rows and n columns is initially filled with water.
 * We may perform an addLand operation which turns the water at position (row, col) into a land.
 * Given a list of positions to operate, count the number of islands after each addLand operation.
 * An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
 * You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 Example:

 Given m = 3, n = 3, positions = [[0,0], [0,1], [1,2], [2,1]].
 Initially, the 2d grid grid is filled with water. (Assume 0 represents water and 1 represents land).

 0 0 0
 0 0 0
 0 0 0
 Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid[0][0] into a land.

 1 0 0
 0 0 0   Number of islands = 1
 0 0 0
 Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid[0][1] into a land.

 1 1 0
 0 0 0   Number of islands = 1
 0 0 0
 Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid[1][2] into a land.

 1 1 0
 0 0 1   Number of islands = 2
 0 0 0
 Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid[2][1] into a land.

 1 1 0
 0 0 1   Number of islands = 3
 0 1 0
 We return the result as an array: [1, 1, 2, 3]

 Challenge:

 Can you do it in time complexity O(k log mn), where k is the length of the positions?
