/**
 * 456. 132 Pattern
 *
 * Given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an,
 * a 132 pattern is a subsequence ai, aj, ak such that i < j < k and ai < ak < aj.
 * Design an algorithm that takes a list of n numbers as input and checks whether there is a 132 pattern in the list.

 Note: n will be less than 15,000.

 Example 1:
 Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]

 Output: False

 Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.
 Example 2:
 Input: [3, 1, 4, 2]

 Output: True

 Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].
 Example 3:
 Input: [-1, 3, 2, 0]

 Output: True

 Explanation: There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1, 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].
