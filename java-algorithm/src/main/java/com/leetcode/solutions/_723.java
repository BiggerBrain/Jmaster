/**
 * 723. Candy Crush
 *
 * This question is about implementing a basic elimination algorithm for Candy Crush.
 * Given a 2D integer array board representing the grid of candy, different positive integers board[i][j]
 * represent different types of candies.
 * A value of board[i][j] = 0 represents that the cell at position (i, j) is empty.
 * The given board represents the state of the game following the player's move.
 * Now, you need to restore the board to a stable state by crushing candies according to the following rules:
 *
 * If three or more candies of the same type are adjacent vertically or horizontally,
 * "crush" them all at the same time - these positions become empty.
 * After crushing all candies simultaneously, if an empty space on the board has candies on top of itself,
 * then these candies will drop until they hit a candy or bottom at the same time.
 * (No new candies will drop outside the top boundary.)
 * After the above steps, there may exist more candies that can be crushed.
 * If so, you need to repeat the above steps.
 * If there does not exist more candies that can be crushed (ie. the board is stable), then return the current board.
 * You need to perform the above rules until the board becomes stable, then return the current board.

 Example 1:

 Input:
 board =
 [[110,5,112,113,114],[210,211,5,213,214],[310,311,3,313,314],[410,411,412,5,414],[5,1,512,3,3],[610,4,1,613,614],[710,1,2,713,714],[810,1,2,1,1],[1,1,2,2,2],[4,1,4,4,1014]]

 Output:
 [[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[110,0,0,0,114],[210,0,0,0,214],[310,0,0,113,314],[410,0,0,213,414],[610,211,112,313,614],[710,311,412,613,714],[810,411,512,713,1014]]
 Explanation:

 Note:
 The length of board will be in the range [3, 50].
 The length of board[i] will be in the range [3, 50].
 Each board[i][j] will initially start as an integer in the range [1, 2000].
