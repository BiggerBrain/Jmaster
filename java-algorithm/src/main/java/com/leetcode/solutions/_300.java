/**
 * 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
 *
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.
 For example,
 Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
 The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4.
 Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.

 Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

 Follow up: Could you improve it to O(nlogn) time complexity?

         * The idea is that as you iterate the sequence,
         * you keep track of the minimum value a subsequence of given length might end with,
         * for all so far possible subsequence lengths.
         * So dp[i] is the minimum value a subsequence of length i+1 might end with.
         * Having this info, for each new number we iterate to,
         * we can determine the longest subsequence where it can be appended using binary search.
         * The final answer is the length of the longest subsequence we found so far.
