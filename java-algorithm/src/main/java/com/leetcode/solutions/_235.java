/**
 * 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
 *
 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
 * “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants
 * (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

          _______6______

    0      4        7       9
  /  \
 3   5

 For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
 Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
