/**
 * 526. Beautiful Arrangement
 *
 * Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N.
 * We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully
 * if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ N) in this array:
 * The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
 * i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
 * Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

 Example 1:

 Input: 2
 Output: 2

 Explanation:

 The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:
 Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).
 Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

 The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:
 Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).
 Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.

 Note:
 N is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.
