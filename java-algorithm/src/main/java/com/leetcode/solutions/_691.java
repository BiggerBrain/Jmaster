/**
 * 691. Stickers to Spell Word
 *
 * We are given N different types of stickers. Each sticker has a lowercase English word on it.
 * You would like to spell out the given target string by cutting individual letters from your collection of stickers and rearranging them.
 * You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite quantities of each sticker.
 * What is the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out the target? If the task is impossible, return -1.

 Example 1:
 Input:
 ["with", "example", "science"], "thehat"
 Output:
 3

 Explanation:
 We can use 2 "with" stickers, and 1 "example" sticker.
 After cutting and rearrange the letters of those stickers, we can form the target "thehat".
 Also, this is the minimum number of stickers necessary to form the target string.

 Example 2:
 Input:
 ["notice", "possible"], "basicbasic"
 Output:
 -1

 Explanation:
 We can't form the target "basicbasic" from cutting letters from the given stickers.

 Note:
 stickers has length in the range [1, 50].
 stickers consists of lowercase English words (without apostrophes).
 target has length in the range [1, 15], and consists of lowercase English letters.
 In all test cases, all words were chosen randomly from the 1000 most common US English words, and the target was chosen as a concatenation of two random words.
 The time limit may be more challenging than usual. It is expected that a 50 sticker test case can be solved within 35ms on average.
